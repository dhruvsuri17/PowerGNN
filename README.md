# PowerGNN
This repository contains code for building and training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict the state of the electricity grid 24 hours ahead. The model leverages the power of graph-based deep learning to understand grid topology, temporal dependencies, and external factors influencing power flow and stability.
